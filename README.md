# Tunisian Fisheries Application

To promote sustainable fishing activity, climate impact knowledge, and co-management of fisheries in the Tunisian exclusive economic zone, we developed the Tunisian Fisheries Application. The application is equipped with data visualization and educational tools, and invasive species monitoring and reporting.

[Co-management App](https://sp2.cs.vt.edu/shiny/comanage/)

The previous quarter focused on functional developement, primarily for educational and data visualization tools describing invasive species such as the African swimming blue crab (*Portunus segnis*) and the Atlantic blue crab (*Callinectis sapidus*). We integrated a map tool that displays observations of both invasive species, sourced from public databases iNaturalist and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Additionally, we source observations from publications. Users of the co-management application can now submit an observation of a blue crab and have that observation immediately visible in the map tool.       

Aesthetic adjustments included adding an application logo, a list of logos for our sponsors, and implementing uniform Recent News photograph height and width. 

We added a user login system that allows users to identify with a stakeholder label (e.g., Fisher, Manager, Seafood Vendor, or Scientist). This system tailors the user experience to their respective label, and creates co-management discussion channels for the different stakeholders.

## Future Quarter

To increase user interaction, we will integrate a discussion forum where users, representing different stakeholders, can comment their feedback of the application as well as discuss topics related to climate impacts, co-management initiatives, and Tunisian fisheries activities and resources. 

Similar to iNaturalist, users will be able to work together to taxonomically identify user-submitted observations and contribute to invasive species monitoring. We will add monitoring and data visualization tools for more invasive species such as the Lionfish (*Pterois miles*) and several jellyfish species. 

We will also improve readability for non-English speakers by providing more Arabic and French language.
